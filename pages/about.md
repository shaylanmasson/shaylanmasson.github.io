<h2>Hi, I'm Shaylan!</h2>

I am currently in my second year of the User Experience Design program at Wilfrid Laurier University. Since a very young age I have had a create mind and a passion for making things. Outside of my class projects I enjoy decorating cakes, taking photos and DIY projects.

I am passionate about making products more user friendly for everyone!
