<h3>Hi, I'm Shaylan!</h3>

I am currently in my second year of the User Experience Design program at Wilfrid Laurier University. Since a very young age I have had a create mind and a passion for making things. Outside of my class projects I enjoy decorating cakes, taking photos and DIY projects.

In high school I took a housing and design course as well as Technological design which was when I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in design. I looked into a few options before I found the User Experience Design program at Wilfrid Laurier and decided that was right for me.

I am passionate about making products more user friendly for everyone! My creative mind, passionate drive, and hard work ethic through professional, educational and recreational activities makes me unique.
