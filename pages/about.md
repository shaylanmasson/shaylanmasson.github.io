<h3>Hi, I'm Shaylan!</h3>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born and raised in a small rural community where I become adventurous and creative from a young age. In 2018, I started studying User Experience Design at Wilfrid Laurier University in Brantford, Ontario and I'm currently in my second year of the UXD Program. My creativity is something I value, and while it helps me inÂ my studies, I also use my creative outlet while decorating cakes and exploring photography. 

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In high school I took a housing and design course as well as Technological design which was when I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in design. I looked into a few options before I found the User Experience Design program at Wilfrid Laurier and decided that was right for me. Since I started at Laurier I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects ranging from the design of spaces, to products and websites. I have had experience designing in groups with clients and individually displaying my knowledge. Through many projects in my classes I have worked to create accessible, ergonomic, functional and creative designs.

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am passionate about making products more user friendly for everyone! My creative mind, passionate drive, and hard work ethic through professional, educational and recreational activities makes me unique.
