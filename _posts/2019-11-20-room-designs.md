  From a young age I have dreamed of designing my "perfect" home. These projects
  allowed me to once again display my creativity and design skills. The floor
  plans, colour schemes, budgets and presentation skills that I used in these
  two assignments are all aspects of a project that I could use in my UX career
  path. These were both fun projects to complete with many skills that I can use
  in university.

In a housing design course as well as Technological Design I created floor plan layouts and walk-through's of the spaces. 

<h2> Tiny House</h2>

For the tiny house project I designed a house based on small dimensions, similar to a trailer, for a make believe couple. Along with the floor plan I had to collect the materials for decor and put the decor designs all into a book. I also had a budget spreadsheet which I laid out all the prices for the products I chose for the house.

<h2> Bedroom Project</h2>

For the bedroom project I was given dimensions of a room and I had to chose what to include, the layout and the colours. I designed with a persona of a female, 16 years old, in mind. Again with this project, I had to create a floor plan as well as a rendered walkthrough of the final bedroom design. I also laid out all the materials that would be included in the bedroom.
