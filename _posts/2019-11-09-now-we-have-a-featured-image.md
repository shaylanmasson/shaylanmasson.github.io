In our Design Thinking course, as a group, we worked with our clients to create a fun, welcoming, and safe place for Laurier and the Brantford community to come together and be creative.

We had areas for collaborating on group projects, individual study pods, computers, sewing machines, music rooms and kitchens just to name a few.

In order to present our final design, we did extensive research into our users through surveying and interviewing, as well as visiting other creative spaces.
