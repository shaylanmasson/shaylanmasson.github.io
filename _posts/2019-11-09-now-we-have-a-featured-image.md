  I have a passion for creating things which made this projects really
  interesting for me. Coming from a small town I did not have a library with any
  fancy equipment or spaces such as a Creativity Hub or Maker Space. I believed
  right from the start of this project that if we designed based on what the
  users wanted we could create a space where students, and the public could come
  and be creative with the equipment provided, something I never had easy access
  to.

In our Design Thinking course, as a group, we worked with our clients to create a fun, inclusive, and safe place for Laurier and the Brantford community to come together and be creative.

Our clients presented to us that they would looking to design a space for people to come in and be creative. At first I was under the impression that they were only looking for design/art spaces however after doing further research we discovered many more forms of art that could be included in this space. Design and arts do not just form around painting, sculpting, drawing etc.. We included spaces for the art of cooking, music, and podcasts. Other areas in our space included areas for collaborating on group projects, individual study pods, computers, sewing machines, music rooms and kitchens.

In order to present our final design, we did extensive research into our users through surveys and interviews. In addition, we looked into other creative spaces online and visited a few of these spaces including The Labs in London Ontario, as a part of our research. 

Many Creative Hubs are costly and our goal was to try and eliminate the cost of participating in this space and make it available and welcoming to all the public, students, children and adults. We worked to integrate all these communities together at a low cost.

At the end of 12 weeks we were able to present this project board, displayed here, to our clients as well as a research package showing all of our findings from the research we completed.
