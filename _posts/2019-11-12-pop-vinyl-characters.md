  Being able to look at an image template and break the design back down into
  layers is something you get better and better the more you practice. Adobe's
  pen tool is a tool that you have to continue practicing. It can be hard at
  first but you have to continue to practice you can master it.

Working in Adobe Illustrator I created these Pop Vinyl characters. Using a variety of tools, such as the pen tool, I created the Pop Vinyl Figure of Carl from the Disney movie UP as well as a design of myself.
