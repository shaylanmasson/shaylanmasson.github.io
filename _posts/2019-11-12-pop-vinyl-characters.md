  Creating these pop-vinyl characters on Abode Illustrator allowed me to
  practice with the pen tool which was a new tool for me to use at the time.
  They also gave me the opportunity to break down the templates into layers in
  the design, which can take lots visualization and patience. The skills I
  learned through building these characters are transferrable to other design
  work that I complete in the Adobe Creative Suite.

Working in Adobe Illustrator I created these Pop Vinyl characters. Using a variety of tools, such as the pen tool, I created the Pop Vinyl Figure of Carl from the Disney movie UP as well as a design of myself. Being able to look at an image template and break the design back down into layers is something you get better and better the more you practice. Adobe's pen tool is a tool that you have to continue practicing. At first it was not easy to use but as you practice and keep trying, you get better.
