<a href="/images/uploads/research-for-you-med-high-fidelity.pdf" target="blank">Research for You</a> is a UX research company that makes the research process easier for everyone! This project involved a lot of research into the participants of UX research and those who are conducting research. I designed this company as a way for UX researchers to have access to possible research participants. With all my data collected I made a prototype of a website which the company would run off of.
