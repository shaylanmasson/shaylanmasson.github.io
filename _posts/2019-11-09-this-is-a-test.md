  In UX, the projects require extensive research into the users. Sometimes when
  researching participants the information they provide might not be the most
  useful towards what you are researching. Because I have been through this
  process and can empathize with both the UX researchers and the participants in
  this research, I wanted to design this company to make the process easier for
  everyone.

<a href="/images/uploads/research-for-you-med-high-fidelity.pdf" target="blank">Research for You</a> is a UX research company that makes the research process easier for everyone! This project involved a lot of research into the participants of UX research and those who are conducting research. I designed this company as a way for UX researchers to have access to possible research participants. 

After completing user research I built 3 personas based off my research participant's needs and wants in order to design this company and website to work best for them. I also looked at other research recruitment companies to see what types of questions they asked and analyzed their websites. Moving forward I began sketching possible wireframes for my website and then went back and completed more user testing.

In the end, with all my data collected I made a prototype of a website which the company would be run off of.
