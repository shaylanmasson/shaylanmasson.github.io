  In UX I have completed many projects that require extensive research into the
  users. Sometimes when researching participants the information they provide
  might not be the most useful towards what you are researching. Because I have
  been through this process and can empathize with both the UX researchers and
  the participants in this research, I wanted to design this company to make the
  process easier for everyone.

<a href="/images/uploads/research-for-you-med-high-fidelity.pdf" target="blank">Research for You</a> is a UX research company that makes the research process easier for everyone! This project involved a lot of research into the participants of UX research and those who are conducting research. I designed this company as a way for UX researchers to have access to possible research participants. With all my data collected I made a prototype of a website which the company would run off of.
