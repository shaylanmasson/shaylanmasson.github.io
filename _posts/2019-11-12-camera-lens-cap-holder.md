  When I first started taking photos I would often put my lens cap holder in the
  pocket of my pants or jacket, or I would put it back in the camera case. One
  problem I found with this was I would often forget where I put it or I'd sit
  on it or it would fall out on the ground. I was inspired to make something
  that would hold my lens cap while still keeping it right with my camera and
  this is when I ended up with the cap holder that attaches to my neck strap.

Photography is another creative outlet I am passionate about. I designed a lens cap holder and then printed the product on a 3-D printer. It now holds my lens cap holder while I am taking photos for easy access as it attaches right to the neck strap of my camera.
