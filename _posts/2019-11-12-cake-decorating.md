  Cake decorating is a skill that takes a lot of experimenting and practice.
  Cake decorating can teach a huge lesson of failure. The materials you are
  working with can be difficult at times, you have to have the right thickness
  of icing to hold but not too thick at the same time, cakes can be fragile and
  and fondant can be frustrating to shape. There are many times when you have to
  experiment, try different tips, icing etc. until you find what is exactly
  right.

I let my creative mind flow through the cakes I decorate.

When I was nine years old I decorated my first cake, it was a farm cake for a contest at a local fair, and have been passionate about cake decorating ever since. Over the years I have decorated many cakes for many different occasions including birthdays, baby showers, retirement parties and many other special events. I have worked with both icing and fondant on my cakes.

Two of my favourites are displayed here. A 3-tier Farm Fun cake with vibrant colours and lots of animals. The second image is of 2-tier baby shower cake for a baby girl.
