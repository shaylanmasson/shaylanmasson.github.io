I let my creative mind flow through the cakes I decorate.

When I was nine years old I decorated my first cake, it was a farm cake for a contest at a local fair, and have been passionate about cake decorating ever since. Over the years I have decorated many cakes for many different occasions including birthdays, baby showers, retirement parties and many other special events. I have worked with both icing and fondant on my cakes.

Two of my favourites are displayed here. A 3-tier Farm Fun cake with vibrant colours and lots of animals. The second image is of 2-tier baby shower cake for a baby girl.
