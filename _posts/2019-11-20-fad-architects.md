  These projects I completed while working at FAD Architects allowed me to
  practice my skills working with client expectations. I had worked on some
  floor layouts before, but this was my first plumbing and electrical drawing.
  Once I was shown the main concept of the drawing I was able to follow along to
  complete this task. Working here proved to me the success in trying new things
  and my ability to learn how to do projects that I may not have had prior
  knowledge of going into the task.

<h2> Client Product Book</h2>

For three summers I worked at FAD Architects in Parry Sound, Ontario. One project I completed was client books. The client I was working with was having their house built on the water and had a style in mind but wanted all the fixtures picked by us. I worked on collecting products that would fit the client's style and price range, then put together a book for them to look through and finalize their decisions.

<h2> Electrical and Plumbing Drawing</h2>

Another project I completed with FAD Architects was electrical and plumbing drawings. Drawing in the outlets and fixtures and the paths of which they would connect.
