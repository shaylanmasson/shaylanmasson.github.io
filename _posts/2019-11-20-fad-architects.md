<h2> Client Product Book</h2>

For three summers I worked at FAD Architects. One project I completed was client books. The client I was working with was having their house built on the water and had a style in mind but wanted all the fixtures picked by us. I worked on collecting products that would fit the client's style and price range, then put together a book for them to look through and finalize their decisions.

<h2> Electrical and Plumbing Drawing</h2>

Another project I completed with FAD Architects was electrical and plumbing drawings.
